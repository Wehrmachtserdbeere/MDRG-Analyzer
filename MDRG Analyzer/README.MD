###Usage

6. Done. You may now check through the other tabs to find your game info.

### Linux

Linux is **not** supported, however, it is confirmed to work using "PlayOnLinux with 64bit" on Pop_OS 22.04 (Thanks to bgrmystr2 for testing this!)

If you use Linux, any technical difficulties will **not** be supported, and I cannot give any support for it.

Known issues:
- It may not work with Pop_OS' built-in Wine.
- The Debug tab may use up a lot of resources, and depending on your save size, may cause the program to stop responding until it finishes loading.
- Resizing the may mess up labels and more.
