# How to nicely add translations

1. Get the Source Code via GitHub

2. Open the project in Visual Studio

3. Create files for the language you want: e.g. German is `Strings.de.resx`
	- `Resources.yourlanguage.resx`
	- `Form1.yourlanguage.resx`
	- `Strings.yourlanguage.resx`

4. Double-Click any of the files

5. Check everything in the menu on the top-left ("Resources", "Form1", "Strings")

6. You should be able to see a column of empty boxes in your language

7. Fill all out that have entries in **BOTH** "Neutral Value" **AND** "de"

8. Save them

9. Double check EVERY menu, every tab, every button, that your translation is complete.

10. Send them to me via the [MDRG Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/SwpQUFWreW)

11. Your translation will be checked for malicious edits, if it is fine, it will be added and you will be credited.

If you don't provide a name you want to be credited as, your Discord Username will be used. You can opt-out of being credited, and will only be credited as "Anon" by mentioning this.
