# Contributing to MDRG Analyzer
I'd love for anyone to contribute to the Program! Some of the things you can do are:

- Reporting bugs
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

# Any contributions you make will be under the same license as this original program.
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same License that covers the project.

# Report bugs using GitHub's [Issues](https://github.com/Wehrmachtserdbeere/MDRG-Analyzer/issues) page
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new [issue](https://github.com/Wehrmachtserdbeere/MDRG-Analyzer/issues).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Bug Reports are to follow this format:

QUICK SUMMARY:
Put a short summary here.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Fairly simple, use a numbered list, a direction (Ex.: Open Program -> Click XYZ Button -> Crash), or a similar, easy to read format.

WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN:
Put here what you expect would have or should have happened. This is recommended, but not a requirement to have.

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS:
Put here what happens if you follow the steps listed in "STEPS TO REPRODUCE".

NOTES:
Things you tried to fix it, weird happenings, client-side related abnormalities (Ex.: Missing letters/fonts, missing numbers, etc.), or other notes that might possibly be relevant to your issue(s).

# Use a Consistent Coding Style
Generally, you should follow the formats I use in my code. This includes:

- Curly Brackets on a newline
- No unnecessarily complex single-line commands (Example of what NOT to do: `List<int> myList = Enumerable.Range(0, 26).Where(a => a > b).Select(_ => k.Init()).ToList();`)
- 4-space tabs
- No obfuscation unless absolutely necessary

If code you want to contribute does not follow these, please add an explaination as to why you believe it should be added in your format.

# What (not) to add
You are welcome to propose anything you'd like. However, there are some things that will have a high(er) chance to be rejected. Examples:

- Malicious code (Instant rejection)
- Fedposts/Fedcode (Instant rejection)
- Invasive features like music, system logging, etc. (Instant rejection)
- (Anti-)Religion (Instant Rejection)
- Politics (Depends on reason, generally rejected unless there's a good reason)

# How to contribute
To contribute, simply open an [Issue](https://github.com/Wehrmachtserdbeere/MDRG-Analyzer/issues) and mark it under the label "contribution". Use the following template:

IMPORTANCE:
How important you think it is. DO NOT MISUSE THESE! Generally, this is assigned like this:
- Extreme (Fixes Security Vulnerabilities, PC Corruption, Bricking, or similar) <--- If your issue is Extreme, add [EXTREME] into your title.
- Important (Fixes heavy bugs, common crashes, or similar critical issues that can cause system crashes or severe disruptions)
- Medium (Fixes regular bugs or similar problems affecting functionality, but not critically so; noticeable glitches or performance issues)
- Low (Fixes minor bugs, typos, or other low-priority issues like cosmetic errors or minor inconsistencies)
- None (Used for any contribution that does not require special attention. Things like new features, graphics, design, minor optimizations, etc.)

WHAT DOES IT DO:
Describe here what your contribution is supposed to achieve or do. You can keep it short, or make it detailed. An example for a short contribution: "Optimize the assigning of variables".

WHY SHOULD IT BE ADDED:
Explain why your contribution should be added. This is in case there are multiple contributions that do the same thing.

CODE:
Put your code directly, or if it is over 10 lines, put it on a site like HateBin. Include instructions of where and how it should be added exactly, if needed.

CREDIT:
If you worked on the contribution alone, state if you want to be credited as your Username, as "Anon"/"Anonymous", or not at all. If multiple people worked on it, state who wants to be credited as what. For example, if four people worked on it, one wanted to be credited directly, two wanted to be credited anonymously, and one did not want to be credited, use this:

- MyUsername123
- Anonymous
- Anonymous
